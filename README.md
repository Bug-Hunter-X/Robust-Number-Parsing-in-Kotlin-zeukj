This repository demonstrates a common Kotlin coding error related to number parsing and provides a robust solution. The original code attempts to parse a comma-separated string of numbers and sum them.  It fails gracefully if there is a NumberFormatException.  However, the improved solution utilizes more sophisticated error handling to provide more detailed information and control over error processing.
